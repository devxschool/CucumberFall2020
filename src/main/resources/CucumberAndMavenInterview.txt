Vladimir - Junit vs TestNG?
Junit and TestNG are both testing tools where we can run methods as tests we can use
@Test annotation.

TestNG - is newer and has better annotations than Junit.
with TestNG we can do parallel execution.

we can use both of them for unit tests.

on my current job we are using testNg for our testing. with our QA team we created our framework from scratch.
from my previous job I have experience in building framework using Junit.
