###Maven

What is maven?


dependency -> your project dependencies -> cucumber, Junit, sql, api and many other libraries.

Maven is a java project and depedency(library) management tool that has been designed to write 
java applications and compile and deploy artifacts like jar, war in an easy fashion. 

Maven originally has been designed for developers. As automation engineers we take advanage of it as well. 

Maven automated many processes and most configurations happen in pom.xml.
So pom.xml is a center of the whole maven project flow.
1. adding new libraries(dependecies)


###.m2 
is a local maven repository - a folder where all of the libraries that we have ever used are stored.
they are not deleted automatically, if you need extra memory you could manually go there and delete unnesseray
libraries.
